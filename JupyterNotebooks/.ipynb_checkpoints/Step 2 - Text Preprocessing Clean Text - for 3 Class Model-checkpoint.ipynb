pimavanserin was safe well tolerated study we announced top line results multi center double blind placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial pimavanserin patients parkinson disease psychosis trial met primary endpoint which was demonstrate that administration pimavanserin did not result deterioration motoric function these patients measured updrs pimavanserin also showed antipsychotic effects secondary endpoints using two different rating scales including saps pimavanserin was safe well tolerated study table contents pimavanserin co therapy schizophrenia combining pimavanserin low dose antipsychotic drug such risperidone commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic drug we believe that optimal relationship between ht receptor blockade partial dopamine receptor blockade can be achieved therefore we believe co therapy pimavanserin may result enhanced efficacy fewer side effects relative existing treatments thereby providing improved therapy patients schizophrenia potentially related psychiatric disorders we reported positive results multi center double blind placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial designed evaluate pimavanserin co therapy patients schizophrenia trial results showed several advantages co therapy pimavanserin mg low dose risperidone patients schizophrenia these advantages included enhanced efficacy comparable that mg standard dose risperidone faster onset antipsychotic action improved side effect profile including significantly less weight gain compared standard dose risperidone if we elect pursue further development indication future we expect that will be through collaboration partner pimavanserin treatment alzheimer disease psychosis patients alzheimer disease psychosis parkinson disease psychosis share many common characteristics they are typically elderly frail often exhibit similar psychiatric symptoms associated their underlying neurodegenerative disease preclinical models alzheimer disease psychosis we have shown that pimavanserin attenuates psychosis related behaviors those models addition pimavanserin has been shown positively interact muscarinic agonists cholinesterase inhibitors enhance their pro cognitive antipsychotic actions preclinical models because its mechanism action favorable safety profile observed date studies conducted elderly patients parkinson disease psychosis we believe that pimavanserin also may be ideally suited address need new treatment alzheimer disease psychosis that safe effective well tolerated we have established protocol phase ii feasibility study evaluate potential pimavanserin treatment alzheimer disease psychosis while our resources are currently focused our phase iii program parkinson disease psychosis we intend pursue our planned feasibility study alzheimer disease psychosis future independently collaboration partner agn xx yy collaboration allergan we have discovered are developing new class small molecule product candidates treatment chronic pain our novel

continue face intense competition pharmaceutical biotechnology companies well numerous academic research institutions governmental agencies both united states abroad we compete will compete applicable existing new products being developed our competitors some these competitors are pursuing development pharmaceuticals that target same diseases conditions that our research development programs target each our clinical programs we intend complete clinical trials designed evaluate potential advantages our product candidates compared current standard care even if we our collaborators are successful developing our product candidates resulting products would compete variety established drugs areas parkinson disease psychosis schizophrenia alzheimer disease psychosis chronic pain glaucoma example

development awaiting fda approval that could reach market become established before we have product sell our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit market any drugs that we may develop some our competitors are using functional genomics technologies other methods identify validate drug targets discover novel small molecule drugs many our competitors their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do following identifying validating targets screening compounds against targets preclinical clinical trials potential pharmaceutical products obtaining fda other regulatory clearances addition many our competitors their collaborators have substantially greater advantages following areas capital resources research development resources manufacturing capabilities sales marketing smaller companies also may prove be significant competitors particularly through proprietary research discoveries collaborative arrangements large pharmaceutical established biotechnology companies many our competitors have products that have been approved are advanced development we face competition other companies academic institutions governmental agencies other public private research organizations collaborative arrangements pharmaceutical biotechnology companies recruiting retaining highly qualified scientific management personnel licenses additional technologies our competitors either alone their collaborators may succeed developing technologies drugs that are more effective safer more affordable more easily administered than ours may achieve patent protection commercialize drugs sooner than us developments others may render our product candidates our technologies obsolete our failure compete effectively could have material adverse affect our business government regulation manufacturing marketing our potential products our ongoing research development activities are subject extensive regulation numerous governmental authorities united states other countries before marketing united states any new drug developed us must undergo rigorous preclinical testing clinical trials extensive regulatory clearance process implemented fda under federal food drug cosmetic act amended fda regulates among other things development testing manufacture safety efficacy record keeping labeling storage approval advertising promotion sale distribution biopharmaceutical products none our product candidates has been approved sale united states any foreign market regulatory review approval process which includes preclinical testing clinical trials each product candidate lengthy expensive uncertain united states product candidates are tested animals until adequate proof safety established clinical trials new product candidates are typically conducted three sequential phases that may overlap phase trials involve initial introduction product candidate into healthy human volunteers emphasis phase trials testing safety adverse effects dosage tolerance metabolism distribution excretion clinical pharmacology phase ii involves studies limited patient population determine initial efficacy compound specific targeted indications determine dosage tolerance optimal dosage identify possible adverse side effects safety risks once compound shows evidence table contents effectiveness found have acceptable safety profile phase ii evaluations phase iii trials are undertaken more fully evaluate clinical outcomes before commencing clinical investigations humans we our collaborators must submit fda investigational new drug application ind regulatory authorities may require additional data before allowing clinical studies commence proceed one phase another could demand that studies be discontinued suspended any time if there are significant safety issues we have past may future rely some our collaborators file inds generally direct regulatory approval process many our potential products clinical testing must also meet requirements clinical trial registration institutional review board oversight informed consent health information privacy good clinical practices establish new product candidate safety efficacy fda requires companies seeking approval market drug product submit extensive preclinical clinical data along other information each indication data information are submitted fda form new drug application nda generating required data information nda takes many years requires expenditure substantial resources information generated process susceptible varying interpretations that could delay limit prevent regulatory approval any stage process failure demonstrate adequately quality safety efficacy product candidate under development would delay prevent regulatory approval product candidate we cannot assure you that even if clinical trials are completed either our collaborators we will submit applications required authorizations manufacture and or market potential products that any such application will be reviewed approved appropriate regulatory authorities timely manner if all under applicable laws fda regulations each nda submitted fda approval usually given internal administrative review within days following submission nda if deemed sufficiently complete permit substantive review fda will file nda fda can refuse file any nda that deems incomplete not properly reviewable fda has established internal goals six months priority review ndas that cover product candidates that offer major advances treatment provide treatment where no adequate therapy exists months standard review non priority ndas however fda not legally required complete its review within these periods these performance goals may change over time moreover outcome review even if generally favorable may not be actual approval but response letter that describes additional work that must be done before nda can be approved fda review nda may involve review recommendations independent fda advisory committee before receiving fda approval market potential product we our collaborators must demonstrate through adequate well controlled clinical studies that potential product safe effective patient population that will be treated if regulatory approval potential product granted approval will be limited those disease states conditions which product approved marketing promoting drug unapproved indication generally prohibited furthermore fda approval may entail ongoing requirements risk management including post marketing studies even if approval

regulatory authorities requirements governing conduct clinical trials marketing authorization pricing reimbursement vary widely country country present foreign marketing authorizations are applied national level although within european community ec registration procedures are available companies wishing market product more than one ec member state if regulatory authority satisfied that adequate evidence safety quality efficacy has been presented marketing authorization will be granted foreign regulatory approval process involves all risks associated fda marketing approval discussed above drugs serious life threatening illnesses federal food drug cosmetic act amended fda regulations provide certain mechanisms accelerated fast track approval potential products intended treat serious life threatening illnesses which have been studied safety effectiveness which demonstrate potential address unmet medical needs these procedures permit early consultation commitment fda regarding preclinical clinical studies necessary gain marketing approval provisions regulatory framework also permit certain cases ndas be approved basis valid surrogate markers product effectiveness thus accelerating normal approval process certain potential products employing our technology might qualify accelerated regulatory procedure even if fda agrees that these potential products qualify accelerated approval procedures fda may deny approval our drugs may require that additional studies be required before approval fda may also require us perform post approval phase iv studies condition such early approval addition fda may impose restrictions distribution and or promotion connection any accelerated approval may withdraw approval if post approval studies do not confirm intended
